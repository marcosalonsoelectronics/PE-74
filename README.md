Material of video PE #74: Single-Stage versus Integrated LED Drivers: A Comparison

Available at: https://youtu.be/rz-7MDLRpAI

In this video a comparison of single-stage versus integrated off-line LED drivers is presented. An off-line LED driver is implemented using two different approaches. The first approach is based on using a high-power-factor single-stage flyback converter, while the second approach relies on the high-power-factor integrated buck-boost-flyback converter. The design of both converters is performed based on the information available from previous work. Simulations are carried out to verify the designs. Experimental prototypes were built at the laboratory to allow for an accurate comparison of both solutions. The converters are compared in terms of volume, reliability, input power factor, line current distortion, and efficiency, among others.
